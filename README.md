# LEARNING STAGE

This repo is here for me to learn how github and versioning works... 
i'm primarily trying to learn backend and the network/dns/domain/IT side more than learning how to design so it may not always be pretty.

that's about it. this is a private repo just because i don't know what i'm doing maybe one day it'll be opened.
